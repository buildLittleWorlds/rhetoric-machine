    <h1>The Rhetoric Machine</h1>
    <h2>An Argument by Demonstration</h2>

    <p>This site works as an argument against the claim made by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90848228/why-generative-ai-scares-artists-but-not-writers">this</a> essay.</p>

    <p>Here's the basic idea of the argument. The essay by Alberto Romero says that visual artists are really worried about AI because art is characterized by very distinctive stylistic elements -- and AI is really good at copying style. But style is much less important for writing, and what is important for writing is something AI just can't do so well.</p>
    <p>This site tests the idea that style isn't such a big deal for writing. The method is simple. At a pretty frequent pace, links will be added below that showcase a pretty well-known passage or quote being rewritten by AI using a different rhetorical form -- a different style. You be the judge of how important the shift in style is.</p>
