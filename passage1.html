    <h1>Passage #1</h1>

    <h2>Original Passage</h2>
    <p>From <em>A Few Good Men</em></p>
    <p>You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall -- you need me on that wall.</p>

    <h2>After the rhetoric machine</h2>
    <p>New rhetorical form: a simple proverb</p>
    <p>In the shadow of the unseen guard, the village sleeps soundly.</p>

    <h2>Again</h2>
    <p>New rhetorical form: a TV ad with a catchy slogan</p>

    <p>[Background Music: Intense, heroic orchestral score]</p>
    <p>[Scene: A bustling party, laughter and chatter fill the air]</p>
    <p>Narrator: "Ever ask yourself why your parties are worry-free?"</p>
    <p>[Cut to: A focused individual standing on a fortified wall]</p>
    <p>Narrator: "That's our secret. We stand guard, so you can stand easy!"</p>
    <p>[Scene: The guard gives a nod, and the camera zooms in]</p>
    <p>Narrator: "Because someone's got to do the night shift!"</p>
    <p>[Slogan Flashes on Screen: "Night Shift Heroesâ€”We Stand Guard, So You Stand Easy!"]</p>
